# UX/UI Designer

Hi, I'm @monsieurBastian and currently working as Frontend and Multimedia Design Team Lead at [SCOTT Sports](https://www.scott-sports.com), currently experiencing with Gatsby.


## About

Father of 3 who likes Sport (swimming, bike, running), cooking and photography. And video games too ;) 


## Project

The idea is to:

Create a basic html page

-> Add Gatsby

Make it a blog

Add styles

Add a CMS (drupal)

Everything nicely auto deploying from Gatsby to my personal website with Github actions
