Father of 3 who likes Sport (swimming, bike, running), cooking and photography. And video games too ;) 


## Project

The idea is to:

[v] Create a basic html page
[v] Add Gatsby (Gatsby Tutorial)
[v] Add styles (Started with Bulma, ended with Chakra)
[v] Make it a blog
[ ] Cover images for blogs
[ ] Previous/next navigation for Blogs
[ ] SEO component with Helmet
[ ] Replace Chakra with Bootstrap ?
[ ] Add a CMS (drupal)

Everything nicely auto deploying from Gatsby to my personal website with Github actions
